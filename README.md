This app allows you to draw the graph of a pair of
[parametric equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation)
in both cartesian and polar coordinates.

For a non-parametric, canvas-based and slightly more
documented version of this project, see [this](https://github.com/stefk/polar).
